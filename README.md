Ultimate Form Wars – Developer Onboarding Challenge
Welcome to FormCore Industries — the quirkiest fake tech company in the world.

Your mission?
Each of you is designing one part of our developer onboarding process. Instead of boring forms, you're building fun, interactive sections that ask questions, generate random traits, or simulate decision-making for our new hires.

Together, your code will create a hilarious and unique onboarding app that collects personality quirks, coding powers, snack preferences, and more — all stored in a single JavaScript object.

To complete the mission:
  1. Create a new branch on this repo. This is where your code will go.
  2. You will work as a team to implement the onboarding process of your imagination.
  3. To finish up, push your branch up to this repo so we can review as a class.
  4. Everything else is up to you.
